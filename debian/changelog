budgie-desktop-environment (0.7.0) zesty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #)
  * Updated Panel configuration
    - AppIndicator Applet is now a default applet (#35)
  * Hide renamed zesty ImageMagick Icon
  * Replace gnome-terminal with Terminix (#33)
    - update plank dockitems to switch from gnome-terminal to Terminix
    - update budgie-desktop-environment gsettings override
  * enable CTRL+ALT_BKSPC key sequence to force-end the X-session (#9)
  * Packaging Changes:
    - move the majority of dependencies and recommendations for the standard
      install to the meta package ubuntu-budgie-desktop
    - change the section from meta to misc since this package is the customisation
      binaries for the standard and minimal desktop installs
    - Rework packaging to accommodate a minimal budgie-desktop installation
      together with revised binary package descriptions.
      panel.ini installed only for the standard installer; file moved
      from binary package budgie-desktop-common thus needs conflict to
      resolve the potential of the same file in two binary packages for users
      upgrading from yakkety to zesty
    - update budgie-desktop-common to include common components for
      both budgie-desktop-minimal and budgie-desktop-environment
    - change budgie-desktop-common and budgie-desktop-environment dependencies
      to ensure icon-themes and fallback icon theme are installed (LP: #1652391)
    - gsettings overrides exist for both installers
    - for both installers ensure we explicitly specify full paths
    - false positive lintian-override moved under the standard installer since
      plank is only installed here.
    - up the debhelper version with standard Debian practice
    - Add postinst and postrm scripts to deal with Terminix configuration
    - up the build standards version
